# Fossil ID

A discord bot for aspiring paleontologists. This bot is designed to help people practice the identification portion of the Science Olympiad Fossils event.

## Usage

The prefix for this bot is `f!`. Use `f!help` to get a list of commands, and `f!help [command]` for help with a specific command.

## Server

For help with the bot, feature requests, or any other questions, please join our support server [here.](https://discord.gg/husFeGG) You can also add the bot to your own server, or use the bot too.

## Contributing

If you have previous programming experience and would like to help us add features or fix issues, feel free to make a pull request. Our code probably isn't of the highest quality, so we value any suggestions you may have.

After you have cloned the project, you must run setup.sh to build redis-server for your computer. Procfile and runtime.txt is necessary only if you plan on using Heroku to host your bot.

If you find an issue with the bot, please report it in the support server instead of opening a Github issue.

**_Happy Identification!_**
